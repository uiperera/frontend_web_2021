      <h1> Yala National Park
        –Home To A Host Of Wildlife And Birds</h1>
      <p>Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a protected
        area of nearly 130,000
        hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands, tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently
        opened to the public.

        Situated in Sri Lanka’s south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary
        in
        1900 and was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for
        the elite under British rule.
        Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world’s
        biggest concentration of leopards,
        majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to
        visit Yala is between February and
        July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open.

      <h1>Anuradhapura
        – The Greatest Monastic City Of Ancient World</h1>
      <p>Anuradhapura was the cradle of glorious Sinhalese Buddhist civilization. The pride of place in Anuradhapura was
        taken by the ancient stupas and ancient reservoirs. Towering stupas (dagobas) of stupendous domes, the marvels
        of ancient civil engineering, were built having taken into the account the effects of lightening on high rise
        constructions, among numerous other engineering factors.
        The vast rainwater reservoirs built by crossing rivers with enormous dams and controlling the outlets with
        "Bisokotuwa" (Sinhala: Queens enclosure-no entry, of course) valve pits (sluice gate), extend lifeline to
        Anuradhapura district to date.

        Among the other tourist attractions at Anuradhapura are magnificent rock carvings of monumental richness and
        remarkable grace;
        colossal stone pillars that stand proud amidst the ruins of royal palaces, Buddhist monasteries and temples;
        magnificent stone cut swimming pools of sophisticated hydrology.

        The splendors of ancient Anuradhapura was narrated in great length by Fa-Hien, the famous Chinese Buddhist
        scholar pilgrim, who spent two years in Anuradhapura copying the Vinaya Pitakaya (Sinhala: Book of Discipline)
        of Theravada Buddhism at the end of the 4th century. The Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus (23 AD - August
        25, 79 AD) has recorded the descriptions of the city of Anuradhapura made by Annius Plocamus, who had visited
        Anuradhapura during the reign of Sinhalese King Sadamuhunu (Chanda-Mukha-Siva) (44 AD- 52 AD).

        Sir William Colebrooke narrates of Anuradhapura "I saw here here ornamented capitals and balustrades, and bas
        reliefs of animals and foliage. I cannot better express my opinion of their elegance than by saying that, had I
        seen them in a museum, I should, without hesitation, have pronounced them to be Grecian or of Grecian descent.
        One semicircular slab, at the foot of a staircase, is carved in a pattern of foliage which I have repeatedly
        seen in works of Greek and Roman origin.</p>
